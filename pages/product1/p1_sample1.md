What systems do we describe when we use the words internal energy, temperature, pressure, heat capacity and entropy? These are words we often use to describe systems which are made of up many (identical, non-interacting) bodies - say the collection of gas molecules in this room, a box of photons (blackbody radiation), white dwarves, neutron stars, quantum fluids ('free' electrons in metals) ... the list is endless! 

A common problem in approaching these many body systems is that it is virtually impossible to obtain *complete information* about them. How can we keep track of the motion of every $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ molecules in a mole of gas? Even if we could have absolute information (position and momentum) on every particle in a box of gas, it is stupid to work out the microscopic motions of every particle and then piece them all together to paint the macroscopic picture when we are only interesting in the *mean* or overall behaviour of the system.

You might think that we are safe from the terrors of incomplete information when we deal with simple systems with one or two bodies. Even with simple systems the imprecision in our instruments introduces an element of *ignorance* in every measurement and it is impossible to have absolute certainty in a measurement. Systems we study (in a laboratory) are never in isolation. They are always embedded in an environment and the interaction between the environment and our system always disturbs the system and we lose track of some information about our system. In the quantum world, the entanglement between the system and the environment leads to quantum decoherence, a transition from a state of complete information to partial ignorance. [^Binney]

An intuitive approach is to use *probabilities* to deal with systems with *incomplete* *information* . The weapon here is, you guessed it, *Statistical* *Mechanics*. It is important to stress that statistical mechanics deals with incomplete information, and we will keep on returning to this idea throughout this course.
