### What is Stat Mech 101?

This site is designed to be a primer in statistical mechanics for people armed with no more maths/physics beyond A-level. The aim of the site is to introduce and elucidate the fundamental ideas of the subject in all its conceptual glory and difficulty. Rigorous mathematical proofs, easily accessible from standard undergraduate textbooks, are not included and maths is kept to the bare minimum. Rather, readers are encouraged to think deeply about the examples given in the text which motivate the ideas of the subject. 

To emphasise on the fundamental and profound nature of the theory, this text keeps allusions to thermodynamic concepts to a minimum and approaches the theory from the point of view of information. In the current version of the text I have yet to include any applications of statistical mechanics to real systems; this will ensue in future versions. 

### What is Statistical Mechanics and why should you bother?

Statistical mechanics is the study of the aggregate behaviour of many-body systems. Such systems include a cup of tea, neutron stars, magnetic materials, Bose-Einstein Condensates, complex networks, and so forth. The list is practically endless. One of the pillars of modern physics, it is virtually inseparable from thermodynamics - the study of heat - and underpins the entirety of physical chemistry.

A quick persual of the impressive list of applications gives  plenty of reasons to care about statistical mechanics. Aside from its ubiquitousness in science, statistical mechanics has profound philosophical implications: at the heart of the subject is the idea of 'ignorance' in scientific investigation. The famous Second Law of Thermodynamics, much maligned in the popular understanding of physics, is often interpreted to mean 'time flows in one direction'. A powerful theory indeed.

### Why should you trust me?

You shouldn't. As of 2016/2017 I have just finished my BA in physics at Oxford and continuing to do a taught masters in mathematical physics, also at Oxford. So I'm fairly green in the long march towards a professional physics career. I beg the pros out there to point out any inevitable errors that may arise or lend me ideas to improve this project.

However, you can be assured that statistical mechanics is my favourite branch of physics and it has my undying devotion.
